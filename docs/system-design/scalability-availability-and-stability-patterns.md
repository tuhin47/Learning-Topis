Scalability, Availability & Stability Patterns
{% endfile %}

## **Trade-Offs**

* ****[**Performance** vs **scalability**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MMeXSTsJovTguoUzGt7/\~/changes/rGuWNtAXiPHZqYF2UyEK/docs/system-design/trade-offs)****
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

### Performance vs scalability

* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.
