# Java Design Patterns

Best practices are called **Design Patterns**

## Principles of Design Patterns

* Composition over _inheritance_ is always preferred.
* Code for the interface not for implementation.

## Types of Design Patterns

1. [Creational](#a-creational-design-pattern)
2. [Structural](#b-structural-design-patterns)
3. [Behavioural](#c-behavioural)

### A. Creational Design Pattern

These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation.

1. [Singleton](docs/pattern/singleton-design-pattern.md)
2. [Factory](docs/pattern/factory-design-pattern.md)
3. Abstract factory
4. [Builder](docs/pattern/builder-design-pattern.md)
5. [Prototype](docs/pattern/prototype-design-pattern.md)

### B. Structural Design Patterns

These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.

1. [Adapter](docs/pattern/adapter-design-pattern.md)
2. [Composite](docs/pattern/composite-design-pattern.md)
3. Proxy
4. Fly weight
5. Facade
6. Bridge
7. Decorator

### C. Behavioural

Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

1. Template Method
2. Mediator
3. Chain of Responsibility
4. [Observer](docs/pattern/observer-design-pattern.md)
5. Strategy
6. Command
7. State
8. Visitor
9. Iterator
10. Interpreter
11. Memento
