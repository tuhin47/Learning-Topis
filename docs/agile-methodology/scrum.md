# ðŸŒ€ Scrum

1. _What is Scrum, and how does it work?_ \
   &#x20;Scrum is a framework for agile project management that emphasizes **iterative** development, teamwork, and continuous improvement. It works by breaking down a project into smaller pieces called **sprints**, which are typically two to four weeks long. Each sprint has a goal or set of goals, and during the sprint, the team works to deliver a **potentially shippable product** increment that meets those goals. \

2. _What are the roles in Scrum, and what are their responsibilities?_ \
   The **Product Owner** is responsible for maintaining the product **backlog**, **prioritizing** items, and ensuring the team is working on the most valuable features. \
   The **Scrum Master** is responsible for facilitating the **Scrum process**, removing obstacles, and promoting self-organization. \
   The **Development Team** is responsible for delivering the product increment during the sprint and continuously improving the product.\

3. _What are the main ceremonies in Scrum, and what is their purpose?_ \
   &#x20;\- **Sprint Planning** is where the team plans the work to be done during the upcoming sprint. \
   &#x20;\- **The Daily Scrum** is a daily meeting where the team discusses progress and obstacles. \
   &#x20;\- **The Sprint Review** is a meeting where the team demonstrates the work done during the sprint to stakeholders. \
   &#x20; \- **The Sprint Retrospective** is a meeting where the team reflects on the sprint and identifies ways to improve.\

4. _How do you estimate user stories in Scrum, and what is the purpose of estimation?_ \
   **** User stories are typically estimated in Scrum using **story points**, a relative measure of effort that takes into account factors like complexity, risk, and uncertainty. The purpose of estimation is to help the team plan and forecast how much work **can be completed** in a sprint or release. It also helps the team identify and manage **dependencies**, and **communicate progress to stakeholders.**\

5. _How do you handle changes in requirements during a sprint?_ \
   **** In Scrum, changes to requirements can be handled using the **Product Backlog.** The Product Owner can prioritize and reprioritize items in the Product Backlog based on changing requirements or stakeholder feedback. If a change to a requirement occurs during a sprint, the team can discuss the change in the Daily Scrum and work with the Product Owner to adjust the scope of the sprint as needed.\

6. What is a **burndown** chart, and what is its purpose? \
   A burndown chart is a **visual representation** of the amount of work remaining in a sprint or release. It shows the total amount of work to be done on the vertical axis and the time on the horizontal axis. The purpose of a burndown chart is to help the team track progress, identify potential delays or issues, and make adjustments as needed to meet the sprint or release goal.
