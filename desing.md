[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ceec4efb-1a95-424e-a933-8897a3797c23/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/learning-topics/deploys)

Best practices are called  Design Patterns

## Principles of Design Patterns

* Composition over _inheritance_ is always preferred.
* Code for the interface not for implementation.

## Types of Design Patterns

1. [Creational]()
2. [Structural]()
3. [Behavioural]()

### A. Creational Design Pattern

These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation.

1. [Singleton](docs/pattern/Singleton-Design-Pattern.md)
2. [Factory](docs/pattern/Factory-Design-Pattern.md)
3. Abstract factory
4. [Builder](docs/pattern/Builder-Design-Pattern.md)
5. [Prototype](docs/pattern/Prototype-Design-Pattern.md)

### B. Structural Design Patterns

These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.

1. [Adapter](docs/pattern/Adapter-Design-Pattern.md)
2. [Composite](docs/pattern/Composite-Design-Pattern.md)
3. Proxy
4. Fly weight
5. Facade
6. Bridge
7. Decorator

### C. Behavioural

Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

1. Template Method
2. Mediator
3. Chain of Responsibility
4. [Observer](docs/pattern/Observer-Design-Pattern.md)
5. Strategy
6. Command
7. State
8. Visitor
9. Iterator
10. Interpreter
11. Memento
